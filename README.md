# Scrabblatan

This will become an awesome Haskell library and mobile app for finding the best Scrabble word just by taking a picture of the game.

## Getting started

### Dictionaries

Because suffix tables of dictionaries can become quite large they should be generated by running the following command:

```
make
```
